Achieving Privacy-Preserving Subset Aggregation in Fog-Enhanced IoT
This is a simple implementation in Java that reports the execution time of each step including:
  step#1. submitting an encrypted query comprising attribute vector, threshold value, and random contamination value.
  step#3. IoT end-device response time.
  step#4. Fog node FN2 generating E(U.Vi-t)||E(D'i).
  step#5. Fog node FN1 generating Ci=E(D'i)^ci.
  step#6. Fog node FN2 aggregate Cis.
 
 *Note: The full implementation will be released when the final decision on the acceptance of the manuscript is made.
